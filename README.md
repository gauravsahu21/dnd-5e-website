# D&D 5e Character Creator Website

Use the folders marked with "stage #" for creating test/concept code. Initially, we will design the overall look and basic functionality of the website before integrating it using React.

Before working, please pull from "main" branch, then create your own local branch and switch to it for whatever work you want to do. Do not merge with "main" without permission.
